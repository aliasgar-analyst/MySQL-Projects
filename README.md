# SQL Projects

This repository includes two SQL analysis projects where I worked with structured datasets to generate insights using queries, aggregations, and joins.

## 1. Football World Cup Analysis (Sky Sports Dataset)

Analyzed World Cup match data to evaluate team performance, goal statistics, and match outcomes.  
Used GROUP BY, aggregate functions, and filtering techniques to extract meaningful insights from competition-level data.

## 2. Uber Ride Data Analysis

Worked with three related tables — Drivers, Passengers, and Rides — to analyze ride activity and performance.  
Performed joins and aggregations to calculate ride counts, revenue metrics, and driver-level statistics.

## Skills Applied
- SELECT, WHERE
- GROUP BY, HAVING
- Aggregate functions
- INNER JOIN
- Subqueries

These projects helped strengthen my understanding of relational databases and practical SQL analysis.
